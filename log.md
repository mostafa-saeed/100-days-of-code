### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 6th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: I started with JavaScript Regular Expressions on FreeCodeCamp.com. It was very interesting to learn about Regular Expressions. I finished 55% of the exercises and also I've done the 'Palindrome Checker' project (The exercises were extremely helpful).

**Thoughts:**
- I've been very uncertain recently about starting the challenge or not. However yesterday I made my mind that I will start the challenge no matter what! I feel so nervous but I believe that's the only way for me getting out of my shell.
- I plan to start with FreeCodeCamp.com to refresh my knowledge. I want to work on the paths:
    - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    - Front End Libraries (I will use Vue.js instead of React)
    - APIs and Microservices
    - Quality Assurance
    - [Maybe] Information Security
- I want to start working on some side-projects after I finish (Or perhaps during the challenge).
- After working with the Regular Expressions today I thought maybe I can tweet about them to help the others.

### Day 2: 7th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: Completed JS Regular Expressions exercises on FreeCodeCamp.com. I'm struggling with the 'Roman Numeral Converter' exercise. However I finished 'Caesars Cipher' & 'Telephone Number Validator' exercises.

**Thoughts:**
- I feel more excited about the challenge.
- I want to create a small project the next weekend (Maybe a bot).

### Day 3: 8th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: Finally I finished the 'Roman Numeral Converter' exercise on FreeCodeCamp.com! Also completed ES6 exercises.

**Thoughts:**
- It was really helpful to get help form others when I was stuck.
- Also It's really a great idea to use Paper & Pen to illustrate the problem and try to divide it to small ones.
- I'm sure my 'Converter' solution was far from being good. But at least it's working! And I'm really happy about this step :)

### Day 4: 9th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: Spent so much time on the 'Cash Register' challenge until finally I had it working xD, Completed all Functional Programming exercise and earned the very first certificate from FreeCodeCamp.com

**Thoughts:**
- I'm so excited to finally start working with vue.js.
- I'm not sure if that possible on FreeCodeCamp.com to complete the FrontEnd challenges in a different framework than the one they use.
- I feel like I want to start working on real projects. However I will stick to the plan!

### Day 5: 10th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: Started working with vue.js ✨✨ and used it to complete the 'Random Quote Machine' challenge. The UI doesn't look pretty good but also not bad and it's responsive 📱. It fetches the quotes from online API then stores them in localStorage. <br>
**Link**: [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/mostafa-saeed/full/JjGZNwR)

**Thoughts:**
- I was surprised when the 'Random Quote Machine' project worked form the first time 😁😁.
- I wrote about my motives to start the challenge [here](README.md).

### Day 6: 11th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: I completed the 'Markdown Previewer' challenge in Vue.js. But had to spend hours trying to get the tests passing. It was working but apparently, the test cases were designed for react.js. So I ended up doing a small workaround to have the tests passed! <br>
**Link**: [Markdown Previewer](https://codepen.io/mostafa-saeed/pen/JjGZeLr)

**Thoughts:**
- The test cases failing has driven me mad today 😡😡😡
- I found other developers had the same issue but not sure what did they do. There's an issue on GitHub here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/testable-projects-fcc/issues/59
- I'm not sure if the project is really in vue.js anymore or not.


### Day 7: 12th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 'Drum Machine' challenge in Vue.js. The same issue as yesterday (I guess it's related to the 2 way data binding) <br>
**Link**: [Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/mostafa-saeed/full/mdVjrVg)

**Thoughts:**
- No thoughts for today ...


### Day 8: 13th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the 'Calculator' project. <br>

**Thoughts:**
- I feel I wasted so much time today because of being disorganized. 😓😓


### Day 9: 14th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 'Calculator' project in vue.js. 🎉🎉 <br>
**Link**: [Calculator](https://codepen.io/mostafa-saeed/details/qBbMEJJ)

**Thoughts:**
- Can't wait to get started with the 'Pomodoro Clock' project because I was planning to apply this technique while working.
- I'm so happy I started making friends on twitter. It just feels like I'm getting over my fear!


### 15th Jul 20

- I had a headache almost all day and I couldn't work. So I won't count this day... 😓😓😓


### Day 10: 16th Jul 20
**Today's Progress**: Started working on the 'Pomodoro Clock' project.

**Thoughts:**
- The UI is nothing but mess 🙄🙄
- The project seems to be working but many test cases didn't pass 😜😜.


### Day 11: 17th Jul 20
**Today's Progress**: continued working on the 'Pomodoro Clock' project. Finally, almost all the tests are passing. However, I guess I need to redesign the play/pause logic to have all of them working.

**Thoughts:**

- This project and the intervals made me really mad. 🤯🤯🤯

### Day 12: 18th Jul 20

**Thoughts:**
- Learnt new stuff about Express.
- I had to use VPN to navigate 'glitch.me'.

### Day 14: 20th Jul 20
**Today's Progress**: So today I wanted to convert my 'Pomodoro Clock' project into a PWA to make it installable across multiple devices and (Thanks to service-workers) make it work offline. Maybe I can add more features for this project, Like saving the timer progress to localStorage. Allowing the user to decide how many cycles he/she wants to complete.

**Thoughts:**
- I'm so keen to start working on real projects 🤩🤩 But I guess I shouldn't distract myself and concentrate on only one thing.
- It was my first time working with Netlify and it was very straight forward.
