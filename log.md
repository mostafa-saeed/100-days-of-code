### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: 6th Jul 20

**Today's Progress**: I started with JavaScript Regular Expressions on FreeCodeCamp.com. It was very interesting to learn about Regular Expressions. I finished 55% of the exercises and also I've done the 'Palindrome Checker' project (The exercises were extremely helpful).

**Thoughts:**
- I've been very uncertain recently about starting the challenge or not. However yesterday I made my mind that I will start the challenge no matter what! I feel so nervous but I believe that's the only way for me getting out of my shell.
- I plan to start with FreeCodeCamp.com to refresh my knowledge. I want to work on the paths:
    - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    - Front End Libraries (I will use Vue.js instead of React)
    - APIs and Microservices
    - Quality Assurance
    - [Maybe] Information Security
- I want to start working on some side-projects after I finish (Or perhaps during the challenge).
- After working with the Regular Expressions today I thought maybe I can tweet about them to help the others.
